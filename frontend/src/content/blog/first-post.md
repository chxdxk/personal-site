Welcome to my first blog post! I'm excited to share my journey of building this portfolio site from scratch.

## Why This Project?

I wanted to accomplish three main goals:
1. Learn AWS cloud services hands-on
2. Build something I'd actually use
3. Practice infrastructure as code

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **Astro** - Fast, content-focused framework
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling
- **TypeScript** - Type safety

### Infrastructure
- **AWS S3** - Static hosting
- **CloudFront** - CDN for fast global delivery
- **Route53** - DNS management
- **OpenTofu** - Infrastructure as code

### Backend (Coming Soon)
- **API Gateway** - RESTful endpoints
- **Lambda** - Serverless functions
- **DynamoDB** - NoSQL database

## What's Next?

I'm planning to add:
- Contact form functionality
- Blog commenting system
- Analytics tracking
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions

Stay tuned for more posts about my learning journey!
