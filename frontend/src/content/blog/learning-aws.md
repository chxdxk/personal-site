When I decided to learn cloud computing, I had to choose between AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. Here's why I chose AWS.

## Market Leader

AWS is the largest cloud provider with roughly 32% market share. This means:
- More job opportunities
- Larger community
- More tutorials and resources
- Battle-tested services

## Free Tier Benefits

AWS offers a generous free tier that includes:
- 1 million Lambda requests per month (always free)
- 5GB of S3 storage for 12 months
- 25GB of DynamoDB storage (always free)
- CloudFront data transfer

Perfect for a learning project like this!

## Serverless First

AWS pioneered serverless computing with Lambda. For my portfolio site, I don't need:
- Server management
- Scaling concerns
- High upfront costs

I only pay for what I use, which for a personal site means just a few dollars per month.

## Learning Path

My plan is to progressively learn:

1. **Storage & CDN** - S3 and CloudFront (current)
2. **Compute** - Lambda functions
3. **APIs** - API Gateway
4. **Databases** - DynamoDB
5. **Infrastructure as Code** - OpenTofu
6. **CI/CD** - GitHub Actions with AWS
7. **Monitoring** - CloudWatch

## Challenges Ahead

I know I'll face challenges:
- IAM permissions can be tricky
- Understanding pricing models
- Debugging Lambda functions
- Setting up proper monitoring

But that's the point - learning by doing!

## Resources I'm Using

- AWS Documentation (comprehensive but dense)
- YouTube tutorials
- AWS Free Tier
- OpenTofu documentation
- This blog to document my progress!

Follow along as I build this site and learn AWS!
