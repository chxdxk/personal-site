## The Journey North

Drove up to Michigan's Upper Peninsula to explore Houghton and the surrounding Keweenaw Peninsula - a place rich in copper mining history and natural beauty.

## Lake Superior

The views of Lake Superior were absolutely stunning. The water is so clear and cold, and the rocky shoreline creates dramatic landscapes. Spent time exploring the beaches and taking in the vastness of the lake.

## Copper Country

Learned about the area's rich copper mining heritage. The historic downtown Houghton has preserved much of its 19th-century architecture, giving you a real sense of what life was like during the mining boom.

## Takeaways

The Upper Peninsula is one of those hidden gems that doesn't get enough attention. If you love nature, history, and getting away from crowds, this is the place to be.
